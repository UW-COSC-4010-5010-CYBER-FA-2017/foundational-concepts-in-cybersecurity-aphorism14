ConceptCode (75)
For each concept (15pt):
Create two small C++programs (10)
Exemplar - e.g. code that does it right. (6)
Non-Example - e.g. code that's wrong - either code you've developed from scratch of code that you've modified (4)
Find/Create a picture / gif that exemplifies the concept (1)
Create a github markdown file explaining each example/non-example, include the picture and relevant code snippets within your markdown file. (4)
Supplemental (10)

Your code should be well documented - each fundamental concept should be separated into it's own directory. Include a global makefile to compile the programs. Include any needed libraries or helper functions. 

Commit this code to github using the following structure:

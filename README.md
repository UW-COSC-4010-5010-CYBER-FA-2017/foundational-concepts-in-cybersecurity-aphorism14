ConceptCode (75)
For each concept (15pt):
Create two small C++programs (10)
Exemplar - e.g. code that does it right. (6)
Non-Example - e.g. code that's wrong - either code you've developed from scratch of code that you've modified (4)
Find/Create a picture / gif that exemplifies the concept (1)
Create a github markdown file explaining each example/non-example, include the picture and relevant code snippets within your markdown file. (4)
Supplemental (10)

Your code should be well documented - each fundamental concept should be separated into it's own directory. Include a global makefile to compile the programs. Include any needed libraries or helper functions. 

Commit this code to github using the following structure:

/REPO_ROOT
- README.md (global - contains highlevel description of assignment and concepts)
- makefile (global)
- ConceptNumber/
   - src/
        - makefile (local, optional)
        - ConceptNumberExemplar
        - ConceptNumberNonExample
   - Image/GIF
   - conceptName.md

10 Principles of Cyber Security

1. Domain Separation
   Means to keep domains separated. What a domain is can be a fairly loose concept. An example would be an Admin area that is separate    from the User area.
2. Process Isolation
   Means to keep processes, which are again a loose concept, isolated from each other. Unrelated systems shouldn't affect each other.
3. Resource Encapsulation
   Encapsulation is an object oriented concept where all data and functions required to use the resource are packaged into a single self-contained component. The goal is to only allow access or manipulation of the resource in the way the designer intended. 
4. Least Privilege
   The principle of least privilege says to allow the minimum number of privileges necessary to accomplish the task. 
5. Modularity
   Modular programming is a software design technique that emphasizes separating the functionality of a program into independent modules.
6. Layering
   Layering in computer security implements multiple layers of computer security, each one having to be conquered before moving to the next. 
7. Abstraction
   The goal in abstraction, from a computer security viewpoint is to remove any clutter that can distract and possibly be used in an incorrect way. Abstraction only provides the essential details of what is being modeled and provide the minimum information necessary to accomplish the task. 
8. Data Hiding
   Data hiding is the technique that does not allow certain aspects of an object to be observed or accessed. Data and information hiding keeps the programmer from having complete access to data structures. It allows access to only what is necessary.
9. Simplicity
   When designing a product, hardware of software, simplicity should be a goal. All unnecessary complexity has been removed. 
10. Minimization
   The goal of minimization is to simplify and decrease the number of ways that software can be exploited. This can include turning off ports that are not needed, reduce the amount of code running, use the concept of least privilege and turn off unneeded features.
